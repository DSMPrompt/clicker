# clicker
The ESP32 firmware for the clicker (Promptly Clicker)

## The code
- Bit janky honestly
- Uses normal BLE connections, hardcoded service UUID
- DONT USE WITH MORE THAN 1 WITHIN 30m (see point above) (will be fixed later)

## Hardware 
- Wiring diagrams and 3D case models will come soon (hopefully!)
